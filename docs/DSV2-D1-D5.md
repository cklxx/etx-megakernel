# DeepSeek D1-D5: go/no-go thresholds, written before the code (2026-10-13)

Work order: `/tmp/claude-dsv2-d1d5.md` (kailun, 2026-10-13); scope: `docs/SCOPE-300TOKS-2026-10-11.md` section 2.
Branch `dsv2-d1d5` off `dsv2-session`. CPU only until a box is opened. Every switch defaults to today's behaviour and
the default path stays byte-identical (checked per item). Pair rules: 5 interleaved pairs in one session, device basis
(embed -> argmax), every invocation 32/32 HF-greedy tokens and 27/27 layers. "KEEP bar" = 30 us/token
(`docs/BASELINE-STATE-2026-10-12.md`, the project's lever bar); "2% bar" = 70 us at ~3.5 ms.

Context measured 2026-10-13 (`examples/dsv2lite/results/2026-10-13-ds_inplace`): the ds_inplace arms ran the SAFE sc1
acquire (no flag); the 3.474 ms record of 2026-09-27 ran `-DETX_ACQUIRE_DOMAIN_RELAXED`. sc1 cost: +242 us in
2026-09-27b (3.987 vs 3.745), consistent with today's sc1 default 3.709 ms.

| item | done on CPU when | GPU threshold (fixed now) |
|---|---|---|
| D1 safe option in the sessions | no DeepSeek session passes the relaxed flag implicitly; relaxed only as a named, explicit arm; default build byte-identical | not a speed lever: GO = the safe build passes 32/32 + 27/27 in every invocation. The paired cost safe - relaxed is RECORDED, expected +235 +- 30 us [E] |
| D2 coherent fleet accessors (Qwen's ETX_VL_COH, ported) | the emitted megakernel has 0 per-task domain `buffer_inv sc1` on the covered events and keeps the producer writeback (counted in the generated code and the ISA); default byte-identical | GO if (a) coherent vs sc1: every pair faster and median >= 70 us; (b) coherent vs relaxed: median difference <= max(2 x relaxed-pair spread, 20 us); (c) 32/32 + 27/27 everywhere |
| D3 four K-chunks (352 rows) | the 4-chunk plan builds and verifies (events, chunk waits), default byte-identical | GO only if every pair faster than one chunk and median >= 30 us and > 2 x spread; otherwise DROP (prior: 512-row chunks 4.020 ms, fleet STATUS.md:33) |
| D4 shared experts during routing + placement check | (a) shared-expert gate_up on the two shared XCDs carries no routing; (b) every routed slice's gate_up and down are on one XCD; (c) the build REFUSES an invalid placement, and a test in the suite proves the refusal fires; default byte-identical | GO if the trace shows the shared XCDs' gate_up ready before the layer's routing completes, and every pair faster with median >= 30 us and > 2 x spread (ceiling ~0.18 ms, scope section 4) |
| D5 compiler prefetch (p7 + kernel hook) | the hook emits a prefetch body for fleet's tiles behind a switch; default byte-identical | DROP if the median is inside the spread or any pair is slower; KEEP only if every pair faster, median >= 30 us and > 2 x spread (prior: --prefetch-next 4% slower, idle prefetch no gain) |
